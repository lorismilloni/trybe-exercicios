# Playground Functions
#### My goal was to:

Writing code using variables and primitive types, dynamic types, logical operators, arithmetic operators and assignment operators. I've also used loop and iterator, if/else, for/in, objects and functions, and how to organize my code, to break problems in little baby steps, and to use programming logic to solve our problems.

#### To be able to see my project running:

- download the repo;
- run the .js file in your terminal;
