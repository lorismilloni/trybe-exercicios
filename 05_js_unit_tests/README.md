# JS Unit Tests
#### My goal was to:

- Write unit tests for functions using Jest to verify the correct operation of these functions;
- From tests already implemented, write functions so that they meet the proposed tests;
- Write tests and functions using a test-driven development approach;

#### To be able to see the tests running:

- download the repo;

- type `npm install` and press inter in your terminal;

- type `npm test` and press enter, the tests will run;
